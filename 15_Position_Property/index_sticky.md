# Position: Sticky

**Definition**:
`position: sticky` is a CSS property that allows an element to switch between `relative` and `fixed` positioning, depending on the user's scroll position. It is particularly useful for creating elements that remain visible within their parent container as the user scrolls.

**How It Works**:
- **Relative Positioning**: Initially, the element is positioned relative to its normal position in the document flow.
- **Fixed Positioning**: When the element reaches a specified threshold (defined by `top`, `right`, `bottom`, or `left`), it "sticks" in place and behaves like a fixed element.

**Key Points**:
1. **Thresholds**: The `top`, `right`, `bottom`, or `left` properties define the point at which the element becomes fixed. For example, `top: 0` means the element will stick to the top of its container when it reaches the top of the viewport.
2. **Parent Container**: The sticky element sticks within the boundaries of its nearest scrolling ancestor (usually its parent container). Once the parent container is scrolled past, the sticky element will scroll away with it.
3. **Browser Support**: Most modern browsers support `position: sticky`, but it's always good to check compatibility if you're targeting older browsers.

**Use Cases**:
- **Sticky Headers**: Keeping a header visible at the top of a section while scrolling through content.
- **Sticky Sidebars**: Keeping a sidebar in view as the user scrolls through a page.
- **Sticky Table Headers**: Keeping table headers visible while scrolling through a long table.

**Example Scenario**:
Imagine a long article with multiple sections. You want the section headers to remain visible at the top of the viewport as the user scrolls through each section. By applying `position: sticky` to the headers and setting `top: 0`, the headers will stick to the top of the viewport when they reach it, providing a better reading experience.

In summary, `position: sticky` is a powerful tool for enhancing user experience by keeping important elements visible within their parent containers as the user scrolls through content.
