In the CSS selector `p,a,.box`, the comma separates multiple selectors. This means the styles defined will apply to all elements that match any of the selectors listed. Specifically:

- `p` targets all `<p>` (paragraph) elements.
- `a` targets all `<a>` (anchor/link) elements.
- `.box` targets all elements with the class `box`.

So, the rule:

```css
p, a, .box {
    padding-top: 47px;
}
```

applies `padding-top: 47px;` to all `<p>` elements, all `<a>` elements, and all elements with the class `box`.
